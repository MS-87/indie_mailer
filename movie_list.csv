The Two Bills,501696,tt7937064,2018-02-01,A look at the tumultuous relationship between coaching legends Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick.,"Bill Belichick will one day join Bill Parcells in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. When the time comes, they'll have far more in common than a place in Canton-or a first name. The Two Bills, directed by Ken Rodgers and produced by NFL Films, traces the four-decade relationship between these two coaching masters. They first met when Belichick was a teenager and his father was coaching for Navy while Parcells was coaching at Army. On the same day in 1979, they became assistants with the New York Giants, and after Parcells took over as head coach, they won two Super Bowls together. Buttressed by what he learned from Parcells, Belichick would go on to win five Super Bowls of his own with the Patriots. Through all the ups and downs of their careers, including some memorable games when they were on opposite sides of the field, they forged a bond that few men of their stature have ever experienced. Two Bills, but one epic story.",en,Released,0,,N/A,8.2,118,,

To explore this coexistence of times, in which the colonial past seems to interrupt the present and the present is sometimes experienced as if we were in the past, Kilomba restages the myth of Echo and Narcissus using the African oral tradition of storytelling. Narcissus becomes a metaphor for a society which has not resolved its colonial history, taking itself and its own image as the only objects of love.

The focal point of this structure is the portrayal of Thai noise musician Thom Assajan-Jakgawan (known as Thom AJ Madson). Thom decided to impose solitary confinement on himself in a small room – a form of hibernation – and meditate on an experiment to give a sound to a plumeria tree.
